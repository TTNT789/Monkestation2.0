changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed the Living Heart ritual deleting your old heart when replacing it instead of having it dramatically burst out of your chest like it should."
  - qol: "The Living Heart ritual will now work if you don't have one at all for some reason, in the same way that'd you use an organic heart in the ritual to replace a cybernetic heart."
  - qol: "The Living Heart ritual, when putting a new heart into your chest, will now heal the heart enough to be just under the \"severe damage\" threshold, if needed."
